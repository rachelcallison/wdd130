    <p>Hi, my name is Rachel! I am pursuing a Computer Science degree. 
        In my free time, I enjoy reading, and writing. Currently, I 
        work on campus with the online course development team, and 
        getting my degree will help me grow my skills to prepare for 
        future opportunities. I am taking this course on web design 
        because I see the value in learning how to create and manage 
        websites, which will benefit me both personally and professionally 
        by giving me practical skills I can use in future projects 
        or my career. My favorite scripture is Alma 7:24 And see 
        that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always 
        abound in good works.
    </p>
